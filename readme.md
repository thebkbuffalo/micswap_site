<h1>Welcome to MicSwap.com

<p>MicSwap is an iOS app developed by Rob Behnke and Gary Levitt.  The function of this app is record snippets of audio, have the ability to edit, filter, and share with the world.  

<p>Although I did not build the iOS app, I was hired to build the website.  Using a template, a bunch of JS/jQuery, custom HTML5/CSS3 I put together a very fun, engaging website to represent this great app.  

Any good suggestions on what I can do to make this better, as all projects can be made better.
